\textcolor{red}{Poro-Mechanics is the study of materials which are influenced by the existence of pore fluid within the material. This influences the mechanical behaviour of material.\\ 
One of the most common material where Poro-Mechanics is used to predict behaviour, is that of soils. A continuum approach is taken to take into consideration the discontinuities that exists within the soil.} (To be changed)
